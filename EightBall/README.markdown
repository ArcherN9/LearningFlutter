This is a sample Dice application I made while learning Flutter from the course
[The Complete 2021 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/).

Concepts Revisited:

1. Inclusion of variables in Dart code
2. Differences between StatefulWidget and StatelessWidget
3. Adding HEX color codes
4. Inclusion of functions in Dart code
5. String interpolation
6. Random number generator

The Quizzler app is a simple quiz application developed using Flutter to learn
application development and understand how various components make up an end
application in the technology.

It fetches quizzes from [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/). A user may
select a category to answer questions from and provide their responses.
Images in the application are retrieved by cross referencing category information
with images available on [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/).

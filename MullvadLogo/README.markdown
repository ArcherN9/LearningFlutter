This is a very basic HelloWorld application I build while learning Flutter
from the course [The Complete 2021 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/).

Concepts learnt:

1. Flutter commandline
2. Setup of Flutter and Dart environment for Vim
3. Inclusion of image assets to the project
4. Addition of application icons

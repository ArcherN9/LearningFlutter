This is a sample business card application that I made while learning Flutter
from the course [The Complete 2021 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/).

Concepts learnt:

1. Rows & Columns and grid layout arrangement
2. Containers
3. Axis Alignments for row/column child positioning
4. Card Layouts
5. CircleAvatar for profile images
6. Custom Fonts and text styles
7. Material Icons and their benefit over using regular images
8. Padding, margins and EdgeInsets in layouts
9. Horizontal Rulers through Dividers

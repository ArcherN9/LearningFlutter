This is a sample Xylophone application I made while learning Flutter from the course
[The Complete 2021 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/).
It populates 7 bar keys on the screen which the user touches to play various 
sounds. As a quirk, I added a random generator that changes the order of the
color palette everytime the app is opened.

Concepts Learnt:

1. Including public libraries published on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/)
2. Playing sound files from the Assets folder
3. Dynamically populating Columns and Rows to create a list of items that fill
the screen
4. Using StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget simulatenously and in cohesiveness
to segment parts that need to be updated dynamically and which not.
5. Dart Lists and its operations
